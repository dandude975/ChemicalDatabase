# ChemicalDatabase

This is an example of a databasing system using MySQL. It allows the user to be able to manipulate the database by adding, viewing or modifying records within a table.
For this example I used the elements of the periodic table as they have a lot of attributes that could be easily converted into manipulatable data.
This program also gives the user the ability to search records as well.

I have written this to be installed with one executable file (at the time of writing this it is only compatible for MacOS users) which allows for easy download.
